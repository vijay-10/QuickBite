# Quick Bite - Food ordering app

- Home page (by fetching the restaurants data through the live API)
- Restaurant Menu page (built a menu for each restaurant, here the learning I got was building a fancy accordion)
- Populated my mini portfolio (About page) using my GitHub data through the GitHub API
- Created a cart which has the list of ordered items (where I learnt about using the latest Redux toolkit efficiently in managing global state)
- Built a dummy user-auth using context API and useEffect by storing the login status in local storage (I know how to perform authentication using express but didn't do it here, since I just wanted to keep this project specific to my react knowledge)
- Created Shimmer effect wherever I had to load API data to give the illusion to the users that the page is fast (Learning: Shimmer gives a feeling of making our page look fast)
- Built a custom hook which makes use of browser API to check if a user is online/offline and renders a page dynamically based on users online status (no more "Aw, Snap" errors when user loses internet connection)
- Built a location tracking custom hook which will fetch restaurants based on our current location latitude and longitude (what use if I show you yummy restaurants based in Hyderabad when you are hungry in Bangalore)
- Built couple of filters "top restaurants" and "search restaurants" using JavaScript logic and basic state management principles for a better search experience for user
- Also learnt lazy loading of components which I learnt would be very beneficial as the application scales. 
- I have also learnt building a react application from scratch (setting it up using parcel which is a build tool to making custom configurations to my application (instead of using the create-react-app)
- Overall, built a decent UI using TailwindCSS.
